<h1><%= @product.name %></h1>

<%= link_to "Back", products_path %>
<%= link_to "Edit", edit_product_path(@product) %>
<%= button_to "Delete", @product, method: :delete, data: { turbo_confirm: "Are you sure?" } %>

<!--> `button_to` generates a form with a single button in it with the "Delete"
text. When this button is clicked, it submits the form which makes a DELETE
request to `/products/:id` which triggers the `destroy` action in our controller.

The `turbo_confirm` data attribute tells the Turbo JS library to ask the user to
confirm before submitting the form. <-->
